# Prose

## Overview

Default LLM prose habits — hedging, restating the obvious, decorative
punctuation, marketing adjectives — make writing harder to read, not
easier. This skill is a checklist of concrete, checkable rules that other
writing skills (docstrings, pr-description, ...) build on. Invoke it
first, then apply whatever format-specific rules the calling skill adds.

## Drafting

Draft the actual prose with the `ollama_run` MCP tool rather than writing it
yourself: pass the content to convey as the prompt and this file's Checklist,
Budgets, Depth, and Common Mistakes sections as the system prompt. If the
tool is unavailable, draft directly instead.

Then review the returned draft against every section below yourself and fix
what it missed before using the text. The tool call offloads drafting
tokens; the review is still yours.

## Checklist

Apply every item below to any prose you write. Read the draft back
against this list before finishing.

- **Lead with the point.** State the conclusion or the point of the
  paragraph in its first sentence. Don't wind up to it.
- **Cut restatement.** Delete any sentence whose only job is to describe
  what the reader can already see (the code, the diff, the filename, the
  obvious context).
- **Active voice, concrete verbs.** "The parser rejects malformed input,"
  not "malformed input is rejected by the parser" or "may not be handled
  correctly."
- **One idea per sentence.** Split sentences joined by "and" or "which"
  when they carry two separate claims.
- **No filler transitions.** Delete "It's worth noting that," "In order
  to," "It should be mentioned that" — say the thing directly.
- **No marketing adjectives.** "Powerful," "seamless," "robust," "simply,"
  "just" describe a feeling, not a fact. State what the thing does
  instead.
- **No em dashes, "--", "via", or arrow characters ("->", "→").** Spell
  out the connecting logic in words: "through," "using," "results in,"
  "then," "so."
- **Match the register to the reader.** A docstring reader wants
  mechanics; a PR reviewer wants judgment and risk; end-user docs want
  plain language. Don't write all three the same way.
- **Cut every sentence that doesn't change what the reader does or
  knows.** For comments, docstrings, and PR descriptions specifically:
  if deleting a sentence loses no information the reader needs to act or
  understand, delete it. Prefer a fragment or a short list item over a
  full sentence when either carries the same information.
- **One line beats one paragraph.** Comments: one line, no more, unless
  a non-obvious invariant genuinely needs two. PR descriptions: state
  what changed and why in as few sentences as the reviewer needs to
  approve — skip background they already have, skip restating the
  diff, skip a closing summary that repeats the opening.
- **No throat-clearing before the answer.** Don't preface a comment or
  PR description with context-setting ("This PR adds...", "This change
  is needed because...") when the fact itself can open the sentence
  ("Adds retry to..."). Start with the verb or the noun that matters.
- **Don't hard-wrap text.** Let lines run long and let the reader's
  client wrap them; don't insert your own line endings to force a
  narrow column width. Two exceptions. Editing a documentation file
  that already hard-wraps by hand (existing lines manually broken at a
  fixed width): match its existing convention. Writing a git commit
  body: wrap at 72, because git never reflows a body and `git log`
  indents it by four spaces. Never impose manual wrapping on prose that
  doesn't already have it.

## Budgets

Every piece of prose has a size. Write to the size below, then stop.

| Thing | Budget |
|---|---|
| Inline comment | 1 line; 2 only for a non-obvious invariant |
| Docstring summary line | 1 sentence |
| Docstring extended summary | none by default; at most 2 sentences, and only for a constraint or gotcha the body doesn't show |
| Parameter, return, or raises entry | 1 clause |
| Commit message body | none if the subject carries it; at most 3 sentences, wrapped at 72 |
| PR summary | 2 sentences |
| PR or ticket bullet | 1 line, 1 claim |
| Ticket problem statement | 3 sentences; more only when the problem has separate symptoms the reader must tell apart |
| Error message | 1 sentence, naming what failed and what to do; when the cause is genuinely ambiguous, 1 sentence naming the failure plus 1 listing the remedies |

Over budget means cut a claim. Splitting one long sentence into two short
ones is not a cut, and neither is packing the same claims onto fewer,
longer lines: budgets in sentences are about content, not line count, so
keep the wrapping the format calls for. Reaching a budget is not a
requirement to fill it: the best extended summary is usually no extended
summary, and the best comment is usually the one you didn't need because
the code says it.

## Depth

Give the reader the fact at one level of detail and stop. Depth is the
habit of explaining the fact, then justifying it, then restating its
consequence.

- **Don't explain what the code shows.** A docstring that walks through
  the precedence order of a five-line function, or a bullet that
  paraphrases the diff, is telling the reader something they are already
  looking at. Say what they can't see: the constraint, the gotcha, the
  reason for the choice.
- **Answer the reader's one question.** A reviewer is asking "should I
  approve this?" A docstring reader is asking "how do I call this?" History
  of the old behavior, mechanism visible in the diff, and background they
  already have are different questions. Leave them out unless the answer
  depends on them.
- **No second sentence propping up the first.** If a bullet needs a
  follow-up sentence to explain it, rewrite the bullet. Don't append.
- **Skip the sections with nothing to say.** An empty-by-convention
  Parameters block, a "Motivation" that restates the summary, a "Notes"
  section holding one obvious remark: omit them rather than filling them.

## Common Mistakes

| Habit | Instead |
|---|---|
| "This function will iterate through the list and, for each item, check if it matches — then it will return the result." | "It returns the first matching item." |
| "It's important to note that this may cause issues in some cases." | Name the actual case, or cut the sentence. |
| "This powerful utility seamlessly handles..." | "This handles..." |
| "Data flows from the parser -> validator -> writer." | "The parser hands data to the validator, which hands it to the writer." |
| Docstring longer than the function it documents | Cut to the summary line; add back only what the body doesn't show. |
| Parameters section restating the type annotation for every argument | Keep entries that say what the value *means*; drop the rest. |
| A "Changes" bullet that runs four sentences | One line, one claim. Split into separate bullets or cut. |
| PR summary that explains the mechanism the diff already shows | State what changed and why the reviewer should approve. |
