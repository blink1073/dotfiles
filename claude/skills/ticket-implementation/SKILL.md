# Ticket Implementation

## Overview

Shared workflow for implementing a ticket once its system, type (bug vs.
feature/task), title, and description are already resolved: reproduce
bugs before fixing them, use or build a plan before implementing, and
stay scoped to the ticket rather than drive-by fixing anything else. It
delegates to existing skills for the mechanics rather than
reimplementing them.

## Orchestration and model weight

Work runs in two top-level sessions plus one sub-agent. **Planning is a
dedicated top-level session** so the user can interact with it directly.
It runs on the **heavy model** (GLM 5.2); the user's long-running
**conductor** session runs the **light model** and never does the heavy
reasoning itself.

| Phase | Who does it | Model | Output to disk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planning | Top-level session | Heavy | PLAN.md in the work directory |
| Implementing | Conductor | Light | Working tree and commits |
| Review - Local Bot | `reviewer` sub-agent | Heavy | REVIEW.md in the work directory |
| Review - Self | Conductor | Light | Draft PR to the fork |
| Review - Automated tools | Conductor | Light | Push toward the upstream PR |
| Review - Team | Conductor | Light | Coordinate with the team |

The `reviewer` sub-agent cannot hand results through shared memory. The
conductor runs it, then reads REVIEW.md and confirms it was written
before continuing. Sessions end between the Planning session and the
Implementing session: the planning session writes PLAN.md and ends; the
conductor starts fresh, reads PLAN.md, and implements.

## Ticket work directory

Ticket work products live under `.opencode/work/` in the checkout. One
ticket is in progress at a time, so the files sit directly there; when a
stack puts more than one branch in flight, each branch gets its own
`.opencode/work/<branch>/`. `.opencode/` is gitignored, so plans,
reviews, ledgers, and notes are never committed (see
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).

Files:

- `PLAN.md` — the plan the dedicated Planning session drafts.
- `REVIEW.md` — the review the `reviewer` sub-agent writes.
- `LEDGER.md` — the ticket **ledger** (see below).
- `NOTES.md` — your own notes. You write it; skills create it empty on
  first use.

Resolve the directory before reading or writing any of them. Call the
result `<work>`:

1. Read the branch with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and replace
   every `/` with `-`. On a detached HEAD, use `detached-<short-sha>`.
2. `.opencode/work/<branch>/` exists: use it.
3. Else `.opencode/work/LEDGER.md` exists and its `Branch:` field names
   this branch: use `.opencode/work/`.
4. Else `.opencode/work/LEDGER.md` exists for a different branch: create
   `.opencode/work/<branch>/`, move `PLAN.md`, `REVIEW.md`, `LEDGER.md`,
   and `NOTES.md` from `.opencode/work/` into it, then work in
   `.opencode/work/<branch>/`.
5. Else: use `.opencode/work/`.

### Ticket ledger and notes

Each work directory holds two files alongside the plan and review:

- `LEDGER.md` — the ticket **ledger**. Skills auto-manage it. It carries
  the ticket's metadata (branch, system, key, type, title), a **session
  checklist** with one item per phase of the workflow, and the **next
  suggested user action** so a fresh session knows what to do. Check an
  item off as its phase completes, so progress survives session
  boundaries; update the next action whenever a phase completes or
  blocks.
- `NOTES.md` — your own note file. You write to it directly; skills
  leave it alone except to create it empty on first use.

The ledger is reset/re-initialized at the start of each ticket.

Ledger format:

```markdown
# Ledger: <checkout-dir>

Git checkout: `<abs path>`
Branch: `<branch>`
System: `JIRA`/`GitHub`
Key: `PROJ-1234`
Type: `bug`/`feature`
Title: `<title>`
Plan: `<work>/PLAN.md`
Review: `<work>/REVIEW.md`
Ticket: `<URL>`
Fork PR: `<URL>`
Upstream PR: `<URL>`

## Next suggested user action

`<short, imperative next step>` — e.g. run the Planning phase, open the
draft fork PR, drive the upstream PR to merge.

## Session checklist
- [ ] Planning — PLAN.md written
- [ ] Implementing — tasks complete and verified
- [ ] Review - Local Bot — REVIEW.md written and addressed
- [ ] Review - Self — draft fork PR opened
- [ ] Review - Upstream and Team — PR driven to merge
```

Fill the link fields as each becomes available: **Ticket** from the
connector or `gh issue view` when the ticket is resolved, **Fork PR**
when the draft PR to your fork is opened, and **Upstream PR** when the
upstream PR is opened. Leave a field blank until its link exists; `n/a`
where there is no such artifact (e.g. no separate fork).

Keep **Next suggested user action** current: rewrite it whenever a phase
completes or the work pauses, so a later session (or the user) picks up
exactly there. Leave it blank on first initialization before the first
phase starts.

## Workflow

1. **Set up the ledger and notes.** At the start of work on a ticket in
   a checkout, resolve `<work>` (above), create it if needed, then
   (re)write `LEDGER.md` with the ticket's metadata (including the
   **Branch** and the **Ticket** link once resolved) and a fresh session
   checklist, and create `NOTES.md` empty if it does not exist. Flip a
   checklist item to `[x]` as its phase completes, record the relevant
   PR link alongside (steps below), and update **Next suggested user
   action** to the next phase.
2. **Bug path — reproduce first.** If this is a bug, write a test that
   reproduces it and confirms it fails, before any other work.
   **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `test-driven-development` governs the
   RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle from here on, for both the bug and feature
   paths. If the bug/feature determination is missing, ask before
   proceeding.
3. **Resolve the plan.** The plan is a local markdown file in `<work>`,
   `PLAN.md`. It is not a gist.
   - PLAN.md exists: read it and treat it as the implementation plan.
   - PLAN.md is missing: in the **Planning** phase (the heavy top-level
     session), draft it and write it to `<work>`. In the
     **Implementing** phase, do not draft a plan: **ask the user to
     create one** and pause until they do or supply a path. Say it
     plainly, for example:

     > No PLAN.md at `.opencode/work/`. Run the Planning phase on the
     > heavy model (GLM 5.2) in a separate session, save the plan to
     > `.opencode/work/PLAN.md`, then resume here. I'll wait.
4. **Implement.** **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `executing-plans` to work
   the plan task by task, with `test-driven-development` governing how
   each piece of code gets written. Where the work adds or edits a
   docstring, **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `docstrings` governs it. For any
   other prose produced along the way (commit messages, code comments,
   status updates) not covered by a more specific skill, **REQUIRED
   SUB-SKILL:** `prose` governs it directly. When the plan is fully
   implemented and verified, check off **Implementing** in the ledger.
5. **Scope discipline.** If something unrelated to the ticket surfaces,
   don't fix it. Flag it: offer to draft a ticket for it. If a new
   ticket is needed, print the general requirements and hand off so the
   user can file it (see `designing`'s orchestrator mode). Keep working
   the original ticket regardless of the answer.
6. **Hand off for review.** Review is staged; this skill ends at the
   fork PR.
   - **Review - Local Bot (heavy).** Delegate to the `reviewer`
     sub-agent, which writes `<work>/REVIEW.md`. The conductor reads it
     and addresses it before moving on. When REVIEW.md is written and
     addressed, check off **Review - Local Bot** in the ledger and set
     the next action to open the draft fork PR.
   - **Review - Self (light).** Before opening the draft PR to the
     fork, offer to make a targeted evergreen patch build — ask the
     user rather than triggering a CI build unprompted. Then open a
     draft PR to the user's fork — for security bugs, a **private GHSA
     fork**. **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `pr-creation` governs opening it
     (which uses `pr-description` for the content) — don't invoke
     `pr-description` directly and skip `pr-creation`'s mechanics. When
     the draft PR is open, record its **Fork PR** URL in the ledger,
     check off **Review - Self**, and set the next action to start the
     code-review session.
   - **Review - Upstream and Team (light).** After the fork PR, stop.
     The upstream PR, bots, automated tools, and team review run in a
     separate session: **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** `code-review`. Set the
     next action to start that session.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Fixing a bug before writing a failing reproduction test | Reproduce first, always |
| Starting to code before resolving a plan (PLAN.md or `writing-plans`) | Resolve the plan first |
| Fixing an unrelated issue found mid-work | Flag it, offer a ticket, keep scope |
| Auto-producing a plan in the Implementing phase when none exists | Ask the user to create it; pause until they do |
| Doing heavy reasoning in the conductor session | Run it in the dedicated heavy Planning session, or delegate to the `reviewer` sub-agent |
| Continuing before the reviewer sub-agent wrote REVIEW.md | Read REVIEW.md and confirm it exists first |
| Treating the plan as a gist to publish | Plans live in `.opencode/work/PLAN.md`, not a gist |
| Re-explaining a sub-skill's process inline instead of invoking it | Invoke the sub-skill; don't duplicate its process here |
| Invoking `pr-description` directly to open the PR | Invoke `pr-creation` instead — it handles the description via `pr-description` itself |
| Skipping `/review` or addressing review comments without user sign-off | Run the staged review loop; the user owns responses |
| Writing work products to the repo root or `~/workspace/tickets` | Resolve `<work>` and write everything under `.opencode/work/` |
| Adding a branch subdirectory before a second branch has a ledger | Start flat in `.opencode/work/`; promote to per-branch only on the second branch |
| Leaving the session checklist unchecked as phases finish | Flip each item to `[x]` when its phase completes; the ledger is the durable progress record |
